This is a beta-release of this software: it is working, but may still contain bugs.

Licence: GPL


Download and installation
=========================

You need to have Java installed on your computer to run this software.  You will almost certainly already have this.  To check, open a teminal/command window and type the command:

	$ java

If you get a load of usage instructions, Java is installed.

If you haven't got Java, see:

	http://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml

Once you have Java, to install this software download it as a .zip file.  To do that click on the little cloud and down-arrow above and to the left on its Github page:

	https://github.com/reprappro/host

which is this page if you are reading this README file on Github.  You will get a file called host-master.zip.

Unzip the download anywhere you like on your computer, say in a directory called my_download.


To run the RepRapPro Slicer Software
====================================

In your unzipped directory my_download/host-master there is a sub-directory called 

	executable

in which there is a file called

	reprap

(or reprap.bat for Windows users).

On Linux, open a teminal window, move to the executable directory, and run the reprap file:

	$ cd my_download/host-master/executable
	$ ./reprap

On Windows do pretty much the same in a command window:

	C: CD my_download\host-master\executable
	C: .\reprap.bat
