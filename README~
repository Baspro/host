This the the RepRapPro Ltd Fork of the RepRap Java Host Software, which forms RepRapPro's multi-colour/multi-material slicer code.

http://reprappro.com

This is a beta-release of this software: it is working, but may still contain bugs.

Licence: GPL


Download and installation
=========================

You need to have Java installed on your computer to run this software.  You will almost certainly already have this.  To check, open a teminal/command-prompt window and type the command:

	$ java

or, on Windows:

	C:\> java

If you get a load of usage instructions, Java is installed.

If you haven't got Java, see:

	http://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml

Once you have Java, to install this software download it as a .zip file.  To do that click on the little cloud and down-arrow above and to the left on its Github page:

	https://github.com/reprappro/host

which is this page if you are reading this README file on Github.  You will get a file called host-master.zip.

Unzip the download anywhere you like on your computer, say in a directory called my_download.


To run the RepRapPro Slicer Software
====================================

In your unzipped directory my_download/host-master there is a sub-directory called 

	executable

in which there is a file called

	reprap

for Linux and Mac users, or

	reprap32.bat or reprap64.bat

for Windows 32-bit or 64-bit users.

On Linux or Mac, open a teminal window, move to the executable directory, and run the reprap file:

	$ cd my_download/host-master/executable
	$ ./reprap

On Windows do pretty much the same in a command-prompt window:

	C:\> cd my_download\host-master\executable
	C:\> reprap.bat

You can, of course, just navigate to the appropriate point in your Windows filesystem and click on reprap.bat to execute it.  Similarly you can set up a Linux system to put an clickable link to the executable on your desktop.  Note that your working directory has to be the same one as the one containing the reprap file for it to work. 

The RepRap teardrop logo is in the file

	my_download/host-master/executable/reprap-icon.png

Which you can use for clickable executables as an icon (though to attach an icon to a .bat file in Windows you first have to change it to an executable, which is a bit tedious.  See: 

	http://www.makeuseof.com/answers/change-icon-bat-file-windows-7/

).

User Documentation
==================

For details of how to use this software, see:

	http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapPro_Slicer 


Experiment with the source code
===============================

Download a copy of the Eclipse Java Development Environment:

	http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Rename

	my_download/host-master

to

	my_download/host

Run Eclipse, select New->Java Project from the File menu and uncheck the "Use default location" box.  Use the "Browse" button to navigate to the directory you just renamed and click "Finish".

To run the software in the development environment open:

	host->src->org.reprap

right click on Main.java and select

	Run as->Java Application

and the slicer should run.

You can then edit the source code and make it crash in all sorts of entertaining ways...
